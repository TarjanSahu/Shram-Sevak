Final project for the fulfilment of PG-DAC from CDAC ACTS Pune by Tarjan Sahu, Ashish Thattikota, Divyanshu Tiwari, Jayesh Sinnarkar and Pranay Gudekar. ||
About the project: "Shram-Sevak provides a sophisticated solution for individuals finding themselves in unfamiliar locations, seeking assistance with tasks. It functions as a refined tool, leveraging advanced technologies such as Java and Spring Boot on the backend and JavaScript and ReactJS on the front end. Like a digital bridge, it facilitates seamless connections between those requiring tasks (clients) and those with the expertise to perform them (workers), all supported by the robust foundation of MySQL in the database. We aim to simplify this connection process, ensuring a smooth and efficient experience regardless of your geographical location."
